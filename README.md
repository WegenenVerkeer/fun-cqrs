[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/strongtyped/fun-cqrs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/strongtyped/fun-cqrs) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/strongtyped/fun-cqrs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

**Fun.CQRS** is a Scala library for building CQRS/ES application. It provides the basic blocks to build event driven aggregates with **Event Sourcing**.

**Fun.CQRS** provides a out-of-the-box `AkkaBackend` and a `InMemoryBackend` for testing. However, it's designed as such that other backend implementations are possible. For instance, an alternative Akka backend based on [Eventuate](https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/eventuate), a Slick backend or RxScala backend could be implementated and plugged in easily.

When using the `AkkaBackend`, Aggregates are immutable classes (case class) that live inside an `Actor`. You don't have to deal much with Akka and it's powerful abstractions, instead you concentrate in modeling your aggregate behavior and its protocol (`Commands` and `Events`). However you still need a minimal understanding of how Akka works and how to configure Akka Persistence to use your persistence plugin of choice.

That said, in **Fun.CQRS**, Aggregates are NOT Actors. The **Actor System** is used as a middleware to manage the aggregates, hold them in-memory, store events, recover aggregate state and generate read models through  **Event Projections**

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

**Fun.CQRS** is undergoing a significant refactoring that will culminate with release 1.0.0. 

A roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/strongtyped/fun-cqrs/blob/develop/roadmap-v1.0.0.md) 

## Migration Guide to v1.0.0

As we progress with the v1.0.0 we update the [migration guide](https://github.com/strongtyped/fun-cqrs/blob/develop/migration-v1.0.0.md). 

Please, make sure you follow all the instructions and broadly test your migrated project before using it with production data.


## Project artifact

The artifacts are published to Sonatype Repository. Simply add the following to your build.sbt.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.strongtyped" %% "fun-cqrs-akka" % "1.0.0-M2"
```

If you want to hack **Fun.CQRS** and develop your own backend, you can import only the core module.
The core module does NOT include the Akka Backend.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.strongtyped" %% "fun-cqrs-core" % "1.0.0-M2"
```

## Documentation

!!! ATTENTION !!! - Documentation is out-of-date as we are in the process of relasing 1.0.0.

The documentation is published [here](http://www.funcqrs.io).

There is also a sample application under fun-cqrs/samples/raffle (up-to-date). 

You can also watch these two videos to better understand the philosophy behind Fun.CQRS.

 Note that this two presentations contains code that have been refactored in the mean time. However, you will get a good picture of the available features by watching the videos.
